Load "Avatar_Emote_FX.unity" for an example scene with all the emotes displayed in a grid (hold down the left mouse button to trigger the effects), or simply drag the required effect from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Remember to parent the effect to the correct part of your avatar character. For example, make Stunned_Stars.prefab a child of the head node, moving it just above the head on the Y axis.

Note that some effects trigger on a single press of the left mouse button (ie Exclamation) while some continue only while the left mouse button is being pressed (ie Sleeping).

Have fun!
